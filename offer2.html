                    <p class="text-left">Whoever said that size doesn't matter was lying to you! Sometimes, the best way to communicate your message is with a trimmed back microsite that is 100% focused on your vision. The biggest advantage of a microsite is that, since it is a HTML build, it isn't too expensive to eventually turn your microsite into a fully fledged website by redesigning the sitemap and adding in new pages and features.<br/><br/>
                    What we are offering for <strong>£500</strong> is a beautifully tailored one page website that is crafted to communicate the message you're looking to get heard. It could be the ideal way to launch a new product, communicate a simple idea, or even act as the foundation for a much bigger campaign. Many people just starting out with an idea request our microsites simply to get something out there so they can get moving with their idea as soon as possible.<br/><br/>
                    Once you provide us with the content and any guidelines you have regarding the message you are trying to communicate, we will pass it over to our dedicated design and development team to turn your idea into something tangible that could very well be the first step to making your idea a reality. Prices start at just <strong>£500</strong>.

                            <h2>Kiwi Terms and Conditions</h2>
                            <p><strong>The Boring Stuff:</strong> We know, we know! No one likes to read through the terms and conditions; but the truth is it's important. Below, we'll outline everything you'll need to know when it comes to your project with us. Don't worry, this is as much to cover your back as it is ours. We want to make sure that you're 100% happy with how it is going and to do that we need to set down our guidelines. We've tried to make it as easy to read as possible. So, here we go!</p>
                            <h3>Our Terms:</h3>
                                <br/><strong>Deposits - </strong>By paying a deposit, or invoice in full, you agree to our terms and conditions set out below and as stated in the initial statement of purpose regarding your project. These terms will be available both on our website and on each invoice you receive from us.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Payment Schedule - </strong>Studio Kiwi will begin work upon the client’s approval of the written agreement and after the deposit is received. The client will pay Studio Kiwi the remaining balance of the payment upon the completion of the project. Studio Kiwi will then release the completed files and materials to the client. Studio Kiwi reserves the right to refuse completion or delivery of work until ALL past due balances are paid.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Additional Changes / Revisions - </strong>Pricing does not include any updates after project is completed. Client will have 3 full rounds of revisions based off the initial draft and Studio Kiwi will provide the client with ample opportunity to review the work and suggest ammendments during the project at the correct times. Additional revisions or substantial changes to a current project or future updates on already completed projects will require a new contract. Studio Kiwi will charge the client at a rate of £40 per hour for any extra content changes outside of the agreed proposal.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Client Responsibilities - </strong>Once the deposit is paid, Studio Kiwi will commence work on the project once they have received <strong>both</strong> the deposit and any and all files and content required for the project.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Early Termination - </strong>If the client decides to back out of the project after work has begun, they will forfeit their entire deposit. They will also forfeit any copyrights to artwork that has already been sent to the client for review.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Accreditation / Promotion - </strong>Once the project is completed, Studio Kiwi has the right to promote any design work for the client in their portfolio. Studio Kiwi also asks that they be credited for any website or print design in the footer of the site/artwork.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Copyright - </strong>The client cannot resell or reuse any stock photography incorporated for any use other than that specific design.</div></p>
