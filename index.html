                            <h2>Kiwi Terms and Conditions</h2>
                            <p><strong>The Boring Stuff:</strong> We know, we know! No one likes to read through the terms and conditions; but the truth is it's important. Below, we'll outline everything you'll need to know when it comes to your project with us. Don't worry, this is as much to cover your back as it is ours. We want to make sure that you're 100% happy with how it is going and to do that we need to set down our guidelines. We've tried to make it as easy to read as possible. So, here we go!</p>
                            <h3>Our Terms:</h3>
                                <br/><strong>Deposits - </strong>By paying a deposit, or invoice in full, you agree to our terms and conditions set out below and as stated in the initial statement of purpose regarding your project. These terms will be available both on our website and on each invoice you receive from us.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Payment Schedule - </strong>Studio Kiwi will begin work upon the client’s approval of the written agreement and after the deposit is received. The client will pay Studio Kiwi the remaining balance of the payment upon the completion of the project. Studio Kiwi will then release the completed files and materials to the client. Studio Kiwi reserves the right to refuse completion or delivery of work until ALL past due balances are paid.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Additional Changes / Revisions - </strong>Pricing does not include any updates after project is completed. Client will have 3 full rounds of revisions based off the initial draft and Studio Kiwi will provide the client with ample opportunity to review the work and suggest ammendments during the project at the correct times. Additional revisions or substantial changes to a current project or future updates on already completed projects will require a new contract. Studio Kiwi will charge the client at a rate of £40 per hour for any extra content changes outside of the agreed proposal.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Client Responsibilities - </strong>Once the deposit is paid, Studio Kiwi will commence work on the project once they have received <strong>both</strong> the deposit and any and all files and content required for the project.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Early Termination - </strong>If the client decides to back out of the project after work has begun, they will forfeit their entire deposit. They will also forfeit any copyrights to artwork that has already been sent to the client for review.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Accreditation / Promotion - </strong>Once the project is completed, Studio Kiwi has the right to promote any design work for the client in their portfolio. Studio Kiwi also asks that they be credited for any website or print design in the footer of the site/artwork.
                                <br/><br/><strong>Copyright - </strong>The client cannot resell or reuse any stock photography incorporated for any use other than that specific design.</div></p>

                            <p>Our design team simply love to create. Whether they're rebranding a client, piecing together a web concept, or even designing for print, our team will produce for you something that you will be proud to display like a badge of honour to promote your business. From branding to graphic design, we cover all aspects that you'd expect from a design studio, and more besides! Feel free to get in touch and we'll get you talking with our team to help you realise your perfect creative vision. Our lead designer has synaesthesia, which means he can taste colours and feel sounds. So that's useful too, we guess.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

                                <br/>Websites are supposed to look pretty. Of course, we all know this. We could spin your head with buzz words and use complex language that is ultimately unimportant, but the end result is the same; your web presence should look great. Not just <i>okay</i>. Our talented team of designers are able to craft the perfect digital home for your company. With a strong web presence, we can help you stand tall amongst your competitors. When your customers go to the website that we build, you can be sure that all of your wonderfully prepared content will be displayed perfectly.

                                <br/>Display advertising is one of the most widely used and successful ways to market your business. However, you can't exactly do that if you don't have anything to display! The Kiwis have you covered as we can provide all the graphics you would need to cover your social media, ad banners, promotional material and more. We also make sure to provide you with online versions of any print work you order from us. Our print designs are typically designed in CMYK mode so that the colours can be more accurately reproduced by the printer; your computer screen displays colours in RGB mode and so CMYK designs look oversaturated - by providing you with both copies of your design, you will be able to use them for online advertising too!</p>

                            <h3>Branding</h3>
                                <br/>Branding isn't just about having a logo. Branding is about leaving a mark; that is where the term originated after all. If your brand doesn't leave a mark in both the heart and mind of your consumer, then it is failing. Luckily, alongside building websites, branding is the thing we know the best. We can help you develop a set of branding guidelines that detail everything from how your logo looks and gets used to the way your brand is referenced online. It is so important to ensure that your online presence is consistent and conveying the message that you think it is conveying. Our work with our clients capitalises on this by constantly reviewing and amending their brand image to ensure that the public perception is shifting in the direction it is supposed to be going.

With us piloting your great idea and building your idea into something firm and tangible, all you have to do is come up with the idea and then let us get to work! We're more than happy to meet with you and see if we can't take the briefest of concepts, smooth the rough edges and turn it into something much greater.

                                <br/>We understand that having a website is one thing but having a website with which you can interact and make changes is often the key point of having a web presence. Many clients choose to keep us on a retainer to make changes month to month, but it there are a few that require the ability to update the site themselves. Doing this typically requires a Content Management System (CMS). This system is essentially an interface that allows you to fill in a few fields and then voila! Your page has been updated. One of the most popular publishers of this sort is Wordpress. It may have started as a mere blogging platform, but it has quickly become one of the most popular web platforms in the world. In fact, Wordpress accounts for around 20% of all websites on the Internet today. If you're looking to make frequent updates yourself, a CMS may be the way to go.

                                <br/>It's no use having a website that looks beautiful on a desktop but falls apart completely when it comes to viewing it on a mobile phone. Similarly, there's no point having separate desktop and mobile sites in an attempt to cover all the bases. The more elegant and modern solution is to configure the site so that it knows how to respond to the screen it is being displayed on. Our team ensure that all of our sites are responsive as standard - the world is moving too quickly for you to have to make do with a site that a growing portion of your audience can't use. With a growing number of people who view the web exclusively on a mobile platform, it is becoming so important to make sure that you're not leaving them having to do that awkward reverse pinch gesture just to read your content.</p>

                            <p>A picture may paint a thousand words, but we are <i>really</i> good at writing.<br/>
                            They say that if you have an unlimited number of monkeys on typewriters, with an infinite amount of time those monkeys will eventually recreate the entire works of William Shakespeare. Well, our team can write better than monkeys can (some of them would argue they can write better than Shakespeare, too) and so whether it's web content, blog posts or press releases, we are confident that we can provide you with outstanding content to craft the ideal campaign for your business. Our team consists of novelists, journalists, and advertisers who share a common passion for writing; a passion that they will use to inspire your customers and make your project truly memorable.<br/><br/>

                            Also, fair warning: we don't really use typewriters for our work (obviously); we just think that they look <i>really</i> nice. Besides, it never hurts to revisit where it all started, right?<br/><br/><br/><br/>

Well written content is a must. Whether its a small "About Me" section on the website or page after page of information detailing each and every service you offer, if your site's content doesn't match up with the great visuals you have on there, people are going to see your brand as lacking substance.<br/>
                                    Whether you're looking to provide a professional, corporate appearance on your site or you're looking to add a more friendly personality to your digital presence, we can provide you with content that will keep your audience lingering on every word. With our content and your great service, your target demographic will be sure to remember you.</p>

                                    <br/>The news world is an ever evolving creature. Full time news reporters have been replaced by an army of bloggers. A vast majority of people find a lot of their news through social media, blogs and other more modern methods. Blogging is an increasingly important tool that can help with your entire digital presence. You can use a blog to build a community, educate your fan base or simply increase your brand awareness. A blog used to be some nerdy guy in a dark room (Hi! Nice to meet you!) typing away about whatever was on his mind... But today, bloggers are the new generation of reporters and it is too valuable a tool for you not to use it. Our team of writers can craft eloquent articles capable of communicating the exact message that you need to reach your audience. They're an experienced bunch that contribute to many communities online; the personality and knowledge that they add to a client's brand is invaluable and will give you the edge you need to stand tall above your competition. </p>

                            <h2>Marketing by Kiwi</h2>
                            <p>Ha! "But what does a cute and cuddly little kitten have to do with marketing?" we hear you scoff! Besides being literally <strong>the greatest animals on the planet</strong> cats know how to market themselves. Did you know that cats are one of the only animals to domesticate themselves? On seeing what a sweet life they could live with humans, they started to exhibit behaviours that we liked so that we would keep them as pets and care for them. In reality, <i>they're the ones keeping us around</i>.<br/><br/>
                            In a way, that is exactly what you need to do with your customers. Your customers are out there, living their lives - you need to show them that you can be a worthwhile asset to keep around and invest in. After all, that's what you want; you want them to keep coming back to you every time they need a service that you provide for them. And that forms the very basics of marketing. Brought to you by cats.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

                                <h3>Digital Marketing</h3>
                                    <br/>Back when we were typing away on those old computers with no user interface other than lines of green text, companies marketed themselves in a very different way. Much of it revolved around creating a strong presence in the targeted community on the high street and this often involved a lot of print work and news coverage.<br/>
                                    Since the advent of the digital age, well... not a lot has changed. When you take away all the buzz words and fancy phrases the goal is ultimately the same. Digital marketing strongly focuses on building a community or following and promoting your brand to them. However, with the powerful tool that is social media and the dominance of smartphones, the methods have evolved. It is now possible to put your brand into the pocket of every person in your demographic, putting your services and products a mere click away.</p>

                                    <br/>Along with constantly evolving methods, digital marketing can give us insights into your viewer/reader/customer's browsing habits like never before. Could you imagine, 30 years ago, having a catalogue full of your products which you could access to find out which sections are receiving the most attention? Utilising analytics reports, we can monitor the online habits of everyone that visits you online. If you're seeing plenty of traffic and engagement in some areas but little to none in others it tells us invaluable information that we can use to help refine your digital strategy. Similarly we can gain useful information on who is visiting you, where they are hearing about you and where they are visiting you from. This information is so helpful in ensuring that you're targeting the demographics that you need to be targeting; if that isn't the case, there's plenty we can do to help you shift your strategy.</p>

                                    <br/>One of the most prevalent methods of forming a digital strategy lies in your Search Engine Optimisation. The way we like to describe this to our clients is as so:
                                    Imagine you've gone to a party where you know nobody. Your aim at this party is to make new friends, connections and learn a bit about the people there so you can learn their likes and dislikes. The best way to achieve your goal is with a lot of talking, telling people about yourself and, most importantly, using the right words. SEO isn't much different. Your content contains everything that search engines know about you and your company; if you use all the right words and portray yourself correctly, when a user searches for something related to your company the search engine effectively says "Hey! I know a guy I met at a party that does that!" In this case you are the guy, the party is the internet and the search engine is that popular prom king or queen who knows <i>everybody</i> </p>

                                <h3>Social Media</h3>
                                    <br/>Your target demographic are (unless you know something we don't) just people. They use the internet like people. They talk like people. They make connections like people. It is so important that you communicate to your audience on a personal level. Chances are that upwards of 90% of your demographic are using some form of Social Media. From Facebook and Twitter to Tumblr and Pinterest to MSN and Myspace (Just kidding! No one uses those last two any more!), your audience are out there tweeting, sharing, <i>communicating</i>. It makes sense then, for your company to build your brand in a place that people can easily communicate with you. Why build a strong web presence out in the sticks where no one will see it, when there is plenty of prime, available space on social networks? The concept of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSG3s7Y9lP0">build it and they will come"</a> is all well and good, but when you have unparalleled access to your audience's social circles, is that not something worth working with?</p>
